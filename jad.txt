TODO - for extension purposes, add subversion (just in case its useful), and featurelevel (in case we need discs to demand a certain hardware featurelevel for decoding)

The JAD/JAC format is designed for use with the JAD library.
It is designed to be simple and compact for embedded platforms.
Consequently the storage is not as compact as it could be.
All values are little endian.

TODO - use sha or md5? sha256 is 32B.. md5 is 16B.. sha1 is 20B.. supposedly md5 is fast. maybe use the one with small code
TODO - consider baking in an offset to the sector data. will be convenient for hex editors and simple tools.

== JADJAC format ==

Every JAD or JAC file begins this way.

ofs | type       | comment
000 | char[8]    | magic ASCII word "JADJAC!\1". The non-ascii 0x01 is helpful for distinguishing textfiles happening to start with this.
008 | u32        | version
00C | u32        | flags 
                   | flags:0 - JAC subformat
010 | u32        | numSectors
014 | u32        | numTocEntries
018 | u32        | reserved for entire file CRC, as needed
01C | u32        | reserved
020 | char[16]   | lets save 16 bytes for recording metadata (intended for disc types e.g. PSX, turboCD, etc.) for extensibility, may contain "EXTENDED" and an 8-byte offset to an extended key/value pair table. may contain other free strings. these should not be necessary for parsing a file, but can save disc identification trouble if present.
030 | u8[N*12]   | The N TOC entries. Could be a nearly arbitrary amount, but may commonly be 102

After that comes sector data or index

===================================================
library structure

The library does not do any independent memory allocation or file IO. These are handled through the jadStream and jadAllocator interfaces.

known dependencies: 
- stdint.h
- stdio.h
